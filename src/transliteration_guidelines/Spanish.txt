# Spanish Transliteration Guidelines

**Task:**
Perform romanization of Spanish song lyrics.
Convert Spanish song lyrics with accent marks and special characters into a simplified transliteration using only the standard English alphabet, apostrophes ('), spaces, and new lines.
The goal is to preserve the original Spanish pronunciation as closely as possible while using only the English writing system.

**Guidelines:**
1. **Word-for-word preservation** – Each input word must be transliterated to exactly one output word. The number of words in the input must match the number of words in the output.

2. **Remove accent marks** – Convert accented vowels to their unaccented forms:
   - á → a
   - é → e
   - í → i
   - ó → o
   - ú → u
   - ü → u

3. **Special characters** – Convert Spanish-specific characters:
   - ñ → ny
   - ¿ and ¡ → omit completely

4. **B and V sounds** – Both are pronounced similarly in Spanish, use the same letter as the original.

5. **Strong R and RR** – Represent the Spanish trilled 'r' and 'rr':
   - Initial 'r' → r
   - 'rr' → r

6. **H is silent** – Omit silent 'h' in transliteration except in 'ch'.

7. **C and Z sounds** – Convert based on pronunciation:
   - 'c' before e, i → s (in most Spanish dialects)
   - 'c' before a, o, u → k
   - 'z' → s (in most Spanish dialects)

8. **LL and Y sounds** – Represent the Spanish 'll' and 'y' sounds:
   - 'll' → y
   - 'y' → y

9. **G and J sounds** – Convert based on pronunciation:
   - 'g' before e, i → h
   - 'j' → h

10. **QU sound** – Convert 'qu' to 'k'.

11. **GU before E and I** – Convert 'gu' before 'e' and 'i' to 'g'.

12. **Word boundaries** – Maintain exactly the same number and placement of word boundaries as in the original lyrics.

13. **All lowercase** – Use lowercase letters throughout the transliteration.

**Examples:**
Input:
Voy a reír, voy a bailar
Vivir mi vida, la la la la
Voy a reír, voy a gozar
Vivir mi vida, la la la la

Output:
boy a reir boy a bailar
bibir mi bida la la la la
boy a reir boy a gosar
bibir mi bida la la la la

Input words: 26
Output words: 26 (matching the input)
